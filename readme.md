### The Problems:

With our busy schedules it's often difficult for us to take time for ourselves and have fun. One activity that I enjoy personally is playing D&D, but that has problems of its own. The biggest one has to do with finding time, sometimes weeks or even months can go by between sessions. In that time we might lose character sheets or just forget what we did in the prior sessions.

### The Solution:

Game Knight is a D&D (or any RPG really) game tracker. With it you can create parties, manage group experience, and members, as well as individual character loot. All of this will be stored online so it won't be a physical responsibility that can be lost like a notebook full of notes. This way you can more easily drop back into a session you might have started last year, reading your notes from the previous sessions to get back into the action.
